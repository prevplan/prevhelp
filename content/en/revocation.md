### Right of revocation for consumers

As a consumer, you have the right to withdraw from the contract within fourteen days without giving any reason.

You have no right to cancellation if you expressly agreed when making your booking that the service's performance should begin before the end of the cancellation period. You have effectively waived your right of withdrawal. We pointed this out to you before the purchase was made.

**Start of the deadline for booking courses or booking consultations**

The cancellation period is fourteen days from the day of the conclusion of the contract. The contract is concluded on the day you receive confirmation from us of the successful booking of the course.

You have your own 14-day right of cancellation for each booking. To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must contact us

in a clear statement (e.g., a letter sent by post, fax, or e-mail) of your decision to withdraw from this contract. You can use this sample cancellation form, which you will find at the end of this document, but which is not mandatory.

To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your notification of exercising your right of cancellation before the cancellation period has expired.

### CONSEQUENCES OF REVOCATION

If you revoke this contract, we have to repay all payments we have received from you at the latest within fourteen days from the day we received the notification of your revocation of this contract. For this repayment, we use the same payment method that you used for the original transaction unless something else was expressly agreed with you; In no case will you be charged any fees for this repayment.

If you made the payment as a bank transfer, please send your account details again as we only see part of your account details on the account statement.

### SAMPLE REVOCATION TEMPLATE

The model for the cancellation form is based on Appendix 2 to Article 246a ยง 1 Paragraph 2 Sentence 1 No. 1 and ยง 2 Paragraph 2 No. 2 EGBGB.
