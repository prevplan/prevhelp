header: Frequently asked questions
replacement_certificate_question: I have lost my certificate. Is it possible to get a new one without taking a new course?
replacement_certificate_answer_1: Of course, it is possible to issue a replacement certificate as long as we still have the associated participation data stored. Depending on the type of course, this is five years, due to official requirements. However, especially in the case of first aid courses, we recommend that you attend a new course to refresh your knowledge if the training took place more than two to three years ago.
replacement_certificate_answer_2: In addition to your personal data, please indicate the course type, the venue and the (approximate) course date in your request.
replacement_certificate_answer_3: To request a replacement certificate, please ideally use our <a href="/contact/" class="font-bold text-blue-600">contact form</a>, or <a href="mailto:info@prevhelp.de" class="font-bold text-blue-600">email</a> us.

course_duration_question: How long do the courses last?
course_duration_answer: The duration of our courses varies depending on the course format and topic. Our first aid courses, for example, last 7.5 hours and thus correspond to the prescribed nine teaching units, including breaks. Unless otherwise stated in the booking overview, our courses take place <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">on one day</span>.

breaks_question: Are there breaks during the courses?
breaks_answer: Of course, there are (several) breaks during our courses. Special care is taken to ensure that the breaks in full-day courses total <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">at least 45 minutes</span>, which makes our courses also suitable for employees and fully complies with the provisions of the Working Hours Act.

certificate_question: When will I receive my certificate?
certificate_answer_1: The certificate will be handed out to the participants <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">at the end of the course</span>.
certificate_answer_2: In the case of in-house training courses in companies, we sometimes do not know the participants' data before the course begins. In these cases, we send the certificates to the sending office immediately after the end of the course.
