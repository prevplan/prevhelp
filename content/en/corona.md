### all trainings possible again without 3G regulation

Due to the current situation and the withdrawal of most regulations by the authorities, we are currently able to conduct our training courses again completely <span class="text-blue-600 font-bold">without 3G regulation</span>.

There is currently <span class="text-blue-600 font-bold">no need to present proof of vaccination or rapid test</span> prior to the start of the course.

If you have Corona (similar) symptoms before the start of the course, we still ask you, if only for your own sake, to voluntarily take a daily rapid test.

#### Mouth-nose protection is still mandatory

Because we are aware of our responsibility towards our instructors and participants, and therefore also towards you, we have decided to continue to make it compulsory to wear mouth-nose protection during our training courses.

Of course, there are sufficient breaks during our training sessions to take a deep breath even _without a mask_.
